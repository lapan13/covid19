                A novel coronavirus (CoV) is a new strain of coronavirus. The
                disease caused by the novel coronavirus first identified in
                Wuhan, China, has been named coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)
                – ‘CO’ stands for corona, ‘VI’ for virus, and ‘D’ for disease.
                Formerly, this disease was referred to as ‘2019 novel
                coronavirus’ or ‘2019-nCoV.’ The COVID-19 virus is a new virus
                linked to the same family of viruses as Severe Acute Respiratory
                Syndrome (SARS) and some types of common cold.

                In more severe cases, infection can cause pneumonia or breathing
                difficulties. More rarely, the disease can be fatal. These
                symptoms are similar to the flu (influenza) or the common cold,
                which are a lot more common than novel coronavirus. This is why
                testing is required to confirm if someone has novel coronavirus.
                It’s important to remember that key prevention measures are the
                same – frequent hand washing, and respiratory hygiene (cover
                your cough or sneeze with a flexed elbow or tissue, then throw
                away the tissue into a closed bin). Also, there is a vaccine for
                the flu – so remember to keep yourself and your child up to date
                with vaccinations.
