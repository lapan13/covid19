              A novel coronavirus (CoV) is a new strain of coronavirus. The
              disease caused by the novel coronavirus first identified in
              Wuhan, China, has been named coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)
              – ‘CO’ stands for corona, ‘VI’ for virus, and ‘D’ for disease.
              Formerly, this disease was referred to as ‘2019 novel
              coronavirus’ or ‘2019-nCoV.’ The COVID-19 virus is a new virus
              linked to the same family of viruses as Severe Acute Respiratory
              Syndrome (SARS) and some types of common cold.

              In more severe cases, infection can cause pneumonia or breathing
              difficulties. More rarely, the disease can be fatal. These
              symptoms are similar to the flu (influenza) or the common cold,
              which are a lot more common than novel coronavirus. This is why
              testing is required to confirm if someone has novel coronavirus.
              It’s important to remember that key prevention measures are the
              same – frequent hand washing, and respiratory hygiene (cover
              your cough or sneeze with a flexed elbow or tissue, then throw
              away the tissue into a closed bin). Also, there is a vaccine for
              the flu – so remember to keep yourself and your child up to date
              with vaccinations.
